python-text-adventure
=====================

A text adventure game engine and sample games. You
might start by copying and modifying simple_game.py.

Planning Your Game
==================

Make a list, or draw a diagram of all the places, and
for each place:

* any *events* that could occur there, their probabilities, and the effect an occurrence would have on your happiness

* any *inventory items* you might find there, and the probabilities of their being found

* any optional *activities* offered there

* *transitions* to the other places, including whether certain inventory items (such as a key) are required to go there

For example, at the library there’s a chance you could 
find a book on programming, and if you do, you then can
go to a coding party. There’s a chance someone will talk
loudly, which upsets you and lowers your happiness.
At the coding party someone could teach you some Python, 
and some other mean person might laugh at your code.
